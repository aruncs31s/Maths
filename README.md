# Maths

## Sine

```

sin(π*i) = i*sinh(π)

sin(-x) = -sin(x) 
```


## Complex integral

```

1.∫f(z)dz = a to b ∫ f(z(t))z'(t)dt

2.c∫f(z)dz = c1∫f(z)dz + c2∫f(z)dz 



```
2. c1 and c2 must be a smooth curve & it is used when c is not a smooth curve but it can be split into 2 `smooth` curves like rectangles sides ⌈ ≫ | & -
