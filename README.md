## Sine

```

sin(π*i) = i*sinh(π)

sin(-x) = -sin(x) 
```


## Complex integral

```

1.∫f(z)dz = a to b ∫ f(z(t))z'(t)dt

2.c∫f(z)dz = c1∫f(z)dz + c2∫f(z)dz 



```
2. c1 and c2 must be a smooth curve & it is used when c is not a smooth curve but it can be split into 2 `smooth` curves like rectangles sides ⌈ ≫ | & - 



## Arun's Maths 

- 0 * ∞ = 1 [proof](#proof)

### Proof

1. *any number times infinity equals infinity*
     *Any number ? What if the number is 0 ?*

2. *0 multiplied by any number ie, zero times any number is equal to zero*
     *any number? what if  the number is infinity ?*

> Considering 1 and 2 
> 0 * ∞ = lies between 0 and infinity(∞)
*what lies between 0 and infinity?* 
> it is 1
