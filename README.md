## Sine

```

sin(π*i) = i*sinh(π)

sin(-x) = -sin(x) 
```


## Complex integral

```

1.∫f(z)dz = a to b ∫ f(z(t))z'(t)dt

2.c∫f(z)dz = c1∫f(z)dz + c2∫f(z)dz 



```
2. c1 and c2 must be a smooth curve & it is used when c is not a smooth curve but it can be split into 2 `smooth` curves like rectangles sides ⌈ ≫ | & -

### Big bang


![Big bang](https://github.com/aruncs31s/twisted-thoughts/blob/main/a-diagram-illustrating-the-expansion-of-the-universe-following-the-C0DMG6.jpg?raw=true)

? If the `expansion` stops or get weaker the gravity will act & the universe will start to recollapse 

*Considering distance btw the stars is less that the graviry will act ie F = Gm1m2/r^2  ie F ∝ r^-1*

If that happens in the future or this have a chance of happening then
1. We should have existed long time ago ie, humans , technology 
2. This Is a Continues process ie begening then  end then Begining there for 
     *? where really is the beginning*
          

**Do your research**




### Infinite Start

We all know or assumed that time started with the “Big Bang” and even the great Stephen Hawking where trying to find out himself that there was a Big Bang Singularity. But there must be one. But Scientists still trying to figure out “what was before the Big Bang”, We can Try to figure it out ourselves by just using our minds.  And it is crazy that we can imagine the Whole Universe in just a few thousand cubic centimeter object called the Brain.
			As I was imagining things, a thought struck me and it goes like this “The time does not start with The Big Bang and So the universe existed Before the Big Bang “.  To justify this, consider the Black Hole as the end of time and the Big Bang as the beginning of time, these two things are related to one another in a way that if we reverse Black Hole we can obtain Big Bang, and if we reverse Big Bang we can obtain Black Hole just like that. But this does not justify my concept and therefore I am suggesting that just imagine the Big Bang, the explosion that started all this. So the time started there so does the universe, and it kept expanding. The expansion of the universe was fast at the start and kept slowing, Even now it is slowing and eventually, it will stop expanding and start to shrink. You do not have to worry about this because this process will take billions of years and the universe is only nearly 13.8 billion years old and we humans only have 100 years to spend and that is just a fraction of time when compared to the life span of the universe.
	But what happens if the expansion stops, it will start to shrink due to gravity and this process will continue and be left with a single singularity and the time stops. we can call this as the end of the universe. Then again the Big Bang explosion happens time starts this process is cyclic and continues forever

- 0 * ∞ = 1 [proof](#1.1-proof)

- 0/0 = 1 


### 1.1 Proof

Considering an inifinty 1/0 

```
if 1/0 = ∞
 0^(-1) = ∞
```
also considering `x * x(inverse) = 1

there for

```
0 * 1/0 = 1 
```
ie ,

```
0 * ∞ = 1 
```

### 1.2 Proof

1. *any number times infinity equals infinity*
     *Any number ? What if the number is 0 ?*

2. *0 multiplied by any number ie, zero times any number is equal to zero*
     *any number? what if  the number is infinity ?*

> Considering 1 and 2 
> 0 * ∞ = lies between 0 and infinity(∞)
*what lies between 0 and infinity?* 
> it is 1 

---
this is more of a concept than a proof

### 2 Proof

1. Considering  0^0 = 1 

 [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_)

- 3^3 = 27 
*if we Considering the above
3^3 = 3*3*3
then 3^2 = 27/3 = 9 
then 3^1 = 9/3 = 3
then 3^0 = 3/3 = 1*

*then considerig this 
0 ^ 3 = 0
0 ^ 2 = 0 / 0 = ∞ 
0 ^ 1 = ∞ / 0 = ∞ * ∞ = ∞ 
then 
0^0 = ∞ / 0 = ∞ ∞ = ∞*

---

- *zero to the power any number is zero* 
>  using this and x/x = 1

> 0 ^ 0 = 0 / 0 = 1
