# Maths

## Sine

```

sin(π*i) = i*sinh(π)

sin(-x) = -sin(x) 
```


## Complex integral

```

1.∫f(z)dz = a to b ∫ f(z(t))z'(t)dt

2.c∫f(z)dz = c1∫f(z)dz + c2∫f(z)dz 



```
2. c1 and c2 must be a smooth curve & it is used when c is not a smooth curve but it can be split into 2 `smooth` curves like rectangles sides ⌈ ≫ | & -

### Big bang


![Big bang](https://github.com/aruncs31s/twisted-thoughts/blob/main/a-diagram-illustrating-the-expansion-of-the-universe-following-the-C0DMG6.jpg?raw=true)

? If the `expansion` stops or get weaker the gravity will act & the universe will start to recollapse 

*Considering distance btw the stars is less that the graviry will act ie F = Gm1m2/r^2  ie F ∝ r^-1*

If that happens in the future or this have a chance of happening then
1. We should have existed long time ago ie, humans , technology 
2. This Is a Continues process ie begening then  end then Begining there for 
     *? where really is the beginning*
          

**Do your research**

## Arun's Maths 

- 0 * ∞ = 1 [proof](#proof)

- 0/0 = 1 


### 1  Proof

1. *any number times infinity equals infinity*
     *Any number ? What if the number is 0 ?*

2. *0 multiplied by any number ie, zero times any number is equal to zero*
     *any number? what if  the number is infinity ?*

> Considering 1 and 2 
> 0 * ∞ = lies between 0 and infinity(∞)
*what lies between 0 and infinity?* 
> it is 1

### 2 Proof

1. Considering  0^0 = 1 

 [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_)

- 3^3 = 27 
*if we Considering the above
3^3 = 3*3*3
then 3^2 = 27/3 = 9 
then 3^1 = 9/3 = 3
then 3^0 = 3/3 = 1*

*then considerig this 
0 ^ 3 = 0
0 ^ 2 = 0 / 0 = ∞ 
0 ^ 1 = ∞ / 0 = ∞ * ∞ = ∞ 
then 
0^0 = ∞ / 0 = ∞ ∞ = ∞*

- *zero to the power any number is zero* 
>  using this and x/x = 1

> 0 ^ 0 = 0 / 0 = 1
